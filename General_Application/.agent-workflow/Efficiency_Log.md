# Efficiency Log (Agent Workflow Retro)

Purpose: capture recurring inefficiencies in agent execution and convert them into reusable rules/skills.

How to use:
- After a big batch (multi-step task, long debugging loop, or slice closure), Sisyphus appends a short entry:
  - What was inefficient
  - Why it happened
  - Concrete prevention (new checklist, new rule, new script)
  - If repeated twice: promote the prevention bullet into `Skills_Learned.md` (keep short)
